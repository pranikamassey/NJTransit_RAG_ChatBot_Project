Topics such as reservations, subscriptions, fares, policies and more are mentioned in the guidelines. It contains everything you need to know and was created to answer your questions about the service. Please read through these guidelines carefully. We hope that after you have read this guide you will be confident in understanding how the paratransit service operates for your best possible riding experience. What Is Access Link? Access Link is NJ TRANSIT\u2019s paratransit service, designed to provide transportation for people with disabilities who are unable to use the local fixed-route bus or light rail systems due to physical or functional limitations. Access Link operates in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Hours Access Link service is comparable to the bus in that it is available during the same days and hours as the regularly scheduled local fixed route bus service, including weekends and holidays. If there is bus service available, Access Link service will be available. If there is no bus service, Access Link will not be available. Shared Ride Access Link is a shared-ride service, which means other passengers may be picked up or dropped off before you reach your destination. This system helps us make the best use of our vehicles, allowing us to serve more customers efficiently. Our scheduling is designed to balance the needs of all riders while providing timely and reliable transportation for everyone. Origin to Destination Access Link provides curb-to-curb transportation service from your origin to your destination, as long as both locations are within the Access Link service area. When the vehicle arrives, you will have 5 minutes to approach it. The driver will assist you with boarding, securing your mobility device, and exiting the vehicle. However, drivers are not allowed to help with any carry-on items. If you need additional assistance, or if you require an accommodation or reasonable modification to the driver's responsibilities, please contact us in advance. Where Does Access Link Go? (Access Link's Service Area) Access Link runs in the same areas and at the same times as our local bus routes and light rail systems. If your pick-up or drop-off location is outside the Access Link service area, a reservationist will help you find nearby cross streets that are"

If your pick-up or drop-off location is outside the Access Link service area, a reservationist will help you find nearby cross streets that are within the service area. You will then need to give the address of a place where you can be picked up or dropped off. Ride Purpose Access Link is similar to NJ TRANSIT's bus and light rail system, allowing you to travel to and from any destination within the service area. We do not ask about the purpose of your trip, and all ride requests are treated equally. We are unable to prioritize ride requests. Fare Access Link is not free. The fare is based on the local fixed-route bus fare, the number of zones you travel through, and any applicable transfer fees. EZ-Wallet is our electronic fare option, and we encourage you to set up a payment profile to avoid handling cash. If you choose to pay with cash, you must have the exact fare, as drivers cannot provide change. You cannot use your reduced fare card on Access Link. Reduced fares are only available for bus, train, and light rail travel. If you have been approved to travel with a personal care attendant (PCA), they can ride for free as long as they are accompanying you. Children under the age of five can ride for free when traveling with a paying Access Link eligible customer. Applying for Access Link Applying for Access Link An interview, either via phone or in-person, is required for full paratransit eligibility.

The team will educate you about available options and schedule you for an interview, if necessar y. Those who request an interview will be scheduled for one with one of our community-based partners. The interview process requires you to provide information about the disability or disabilities that are preventing you from using the local bus to travel to or from your intended destinations.

Mobility Devices Access Link vehicles are accessible and can accommodate wheelchairs, scooters, or other mobility devices. Devices not primarily designed for use by individuals with mobility impairments are not required to be accommodated. A wheelchair is defined as \u201ca mobility aid belonging to any class of three- or more-wheeled devices, usable indoors, designed or modified for and used by individuals with mobility impairments, whether operated manually or powered.\u201d Access Link vehicles will accommodate all customers with mobility devices unless the weight/size exceeds the lift securement area capacity, or if there is a legitimate safety concern. Access Link requires all customers to have their wheelchairs secured while aboard an Access Link vehicle, or services may be declined. Access Link may not transport you if your mobility device is broken or malfunctioning. Broken brakes, safety belts, wheels, weak batteries, or other problems with mobility devices cause a safety concern for all.

Your ride will be considered a late cancellation if you call Access Link more than 50 minutes but less than 2 hours before your scheduled pick-up window. Your ride will be considered a no-show if you do not call to cancel your ride at least 50 minutes before your scheduled pick-up window, or you do not board the vehicle within the five minute wait time. If you no-show a scheduled ride, you must call Access Link within 60 minutes in order to confirm any ride reservations for later that day. We also asked that you are ready during your window and remember that the operator can only wait 5 minutes for you to board the vehicle. No Show and Late Cancelation Infraction Suspension Policy Special Note: The full policy and guidance on disputing and appealing are available on Access Link Online and in the Customer Guidelines Canceling Your Ride: If you no longer need a scheduled ride, you must cancel at least two hours before the scheduled pick-up window.

Each NS is equivalent to 2 points. Each time a customer accrues at least 6 or more points worth of infractions in a calendar month, they will be sent an Infraction Warning letter. This Infraction Warning letter is to make the customer aware of infractions they have accumulated thus far. Customers who receive infractions throughout a calendar month will become candidates for suspension when they have met the following conditions: Have booked at least (10) ten rides in a calendar month. (This ride count consists of performed rides, and any ride that received a (NS) No Show, (NI) No Show in Transit or (CL) Late Cancellation.) AND Have accumulated enough (NS) No Shows, (NI) No Shows in Transit, or (CL) Late Cancellation points that amount to at least (20%) twenty percent of your booked rides in the same calendar month. Infraction Calculation Example: If you took 27 rides in a month and got 6.5 infraction points (for things like No Shows, Late Cancellations, or No Shows in Transit), here's how we will figure out your infraction percentage: We will take the number of infraction points and divide it by the total number of rides. 6.5 \u00f7 27 = 24%. So, 24% of your rides had infractions. Suspension Timeline for Infractions: First Violation: Suspension Warning Second Violation: 7-day suspension Third Violation: 14-day suspension Fourth Violation: 21-day suspension Fifth and Subsequent Violations: 30-day suspension Please note, based on the number of infractions points you accumulate in comparison to the number of rides taken, it is possible to have already qualified for a temporary suspension of service by the time you receive an Infraction Warning letter. It is also possible to receive an Infraction Warning letter and Suspension letter at the same time. Suspensions always start on a Sunday and generally ends on a Saturday. If you qualify for suspension, you will receive a Suspension letter with the infraction details and suspension dates as well as the information needed to file an appeal. We encourage customers to dispute any infractions they do not agree with or infractions that were issued for reasons that were beyond their control.

Community Transportation providers use smaller lift equipped vans and minibuses and may operate route deviation, curb to curb, door to door, or on an advance reservation basis. Services may also feed into existing mass transit bus stops, train or light rail stations. Although there are some services open to the general public, others have eligibility requirements and may be restricted to senior citizens, people with disabilities, or social services clients. Many of the services in New Jersey are funded by NJ TRANSIT with grants from the Federal Transit Administration under Sections 5307, 5310, 5311, with state funds from New Jersey's Casino Revenue fund under the Senior Citizens and Disabled Residents Transportation Assistance Program and NJ TRANSIT. If you are a subrecipient of any grants administered by NJ TRANSIT and would like to submit ridership and maintenance reports through S-RIDES or would like to know about grants administered for Community Transportation, please visit: https://s-rides.njtransit.com/home/loginHome.aspx For travel training opportunities contact New Jersey Travel Independence Program (NJTIP) that teaches individuals with disabilities and older adults how to use public transportation safely and independently. NJTIP customers learn how to read bus and train schedules, plan their trips, pay their fares and take safety precautions. The only cost to customers during training is paying their own fares.
